##Vertica & T-SQL Queries 
Vertica7.2 is installed on my guest CentOS 7 system on the single node. 

I have installed vmtool in vmware to set up share folder and installed Vertica through command line. 

Admintools and vsql are used to maintain databases on Vertica. 

Screenshots of T-SQL queries and output have been included in the pdf file.
